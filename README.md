### Things to know
- Students **have to create their own directory** to group all their resources. Feel free to structure directory on your own.

- MRs will be approved and can be merged,
    - **once you complete your assinged presentations.**
    - Any comments you have in your MR are resolved.

### Example dir structure

```
network-programming(repo)
    |
    |--ram-pandey
        |
        |--programs
        |    |
        |    |----Unit1
        |        |
        |        |--Program1.java
        |        |--Program2.java
        |
        |--notes
            |
            |--note1.pdf
```

### Note:
