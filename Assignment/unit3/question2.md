A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to describe the identity of an item by providing detailed information on how to access it. It typically links to a web page, a component of a web page, or a program on a web page using methods like protocols. A URL specifies the protocol (such as HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name, the path to the resource, and other components like hash fragments. It is used to determine the exact location and access method of a resource on the web, ensuring that the proper protocol is used for retrieval.urn:movie:Inception-2010 (This is a unique identifier for the movie Inception, but it doesn't tell you where you can watch it or how to get to it.)

In contrast, a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a broader concept that defines the identity of an item without specifying how to access it. It is used to distinguish one resource from another, regardless of the method used to retrieve it. Unlike URLs, URIs do not include the protocol specification. A URI may contain components like the scheme, authority, path, and query, but it does not tell you how to access the resource. Essentially, a URL is a type of URI, and a URI is a superset of a URL—while a URI can uniquely identify a resource, a URL provides the necessary information to locate and access that resource.https://www.netflix.com/watch/70131314 (This URL tells you exactly where you can stream the movie Inception on Netflix, providing a specific web address and the method to access it.)

//Can all URLs be URIs? Why?
Yes, all URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs. The reason is that a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). A URL provides both the identity and the location of a resource on the web, along with the method (protocol) used to access it. For instance, a URL specifies the protocol (such as https://), the domain (like www.example.com), and the path to the resource (e.g., /index.html), which are all part of the web address required to access that resource.

On the other hand, a URI is a more general term that refers to any identifier for a resource, whether or not it provides access information. While a URL always identifies and locates a resource with access methods, a URN (Uniform Resource Name) is another type of URI that only provides the identity of the resource without specifying how to access it. Thus, since URLs are a subset of URIs, all URLs are URIs because they identify a resource, but not all URIs are URLs, as URIs can also include URNs, which don’t provide location or access methods.
