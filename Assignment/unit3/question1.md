A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet. It specifies the location of a resource on the web and how to retrieve it. A URL consists of several components that define where and how to access a particular resource, such as a webpage, image, file, or video.

Components of a URL:
A typical URL is made up of the following components:

Scheme (Protocol): Defines how the resource will be accessed (e.g., http, https, ftp).
Host (Domain): Specifies the server or host that holds the resource (e.g., www.example.com).
Port: Defines the network port on the host used for communication (e.g., 80, 443). If omitted, default ports for HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443) are used.
Path: Specifies the location of the resource on the server (e.g., /images/logo.png).
Query: Provides additional parameters for the resource (e.g., ?id=123&sort=desc).
Fragment: Refers to a specific section within the resource (e.g., #section1).
