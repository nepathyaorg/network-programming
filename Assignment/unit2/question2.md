The getHostName() method returns the hostname of the machine or domain associated with the InetAddress. If the domain has an alias, it will return the alias name, meaning it could return either the hostname or an alias for the host. On the other hand, the getCanonicalHostName() method returns the canonical (official) hostname of the machine or domain. It resolves any aliases or redirects, providing the "true" or primary domain name. In cases where the system or network has multiple domain names for the same machine, getCanonicalHostName() will return the primary or official domain name.
