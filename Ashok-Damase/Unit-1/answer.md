# **UNIT 1**

## How Does Client-Server Architecture Work?

Client-server architecture is a model where multiple clients (users or devices) request services from a centralized server. The server processes these requests and sends responses back to the clients. This model is commonly used in web applications, databases, and cloud computing.

### Key Components:
- **Client:** Requests data or services (e.g., web browser, mobile app).
- **Server:** Processes client requests and provides responses (e.g., web server, database server).
- **Network:** Facilitates communication between client and server (e.g., the internet, LAN).

### How It Works:
1. The client sends a request to the server over a network.
2. The server processes the request.
3. The server sends a response back to the client.
4. The client displays or processes the received data.

## Factors to Consider When Designing Software

When designing software, several factors should be considered to ensure efficiency, scalability, and security:

1. **Scalability** – The software should handle an increasing number of users or data without performance degradation.
2. **Security** – Implement encryption, authentication, and authorization to protect data.
3. **Performance** – Optimize code and network usage for faster response times.
4. **Maintainability** – Write clean, modular, and well-documented code for easy updates.
5. **Reliability** – Ensure the system functions correctly under different conditions.
6. **Usability** – Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
7. **Platform Compatibility** – Ensure support across different operating systems and devices.

## Why Do We Need Network Programming Tools and Platforms?

Network programming tools and platforms simplify the development of network-based applications by providing libraries, frameworks, and utilities to handle communication, security, and data transmission efficiently.

### Some Important Tools and Platforms:

1. **Sockets** – Allow direct communication between client and server over TCP/UDP.
2. **REST APIs** – Enable communication between distributed systems using HTTP.
3. **WebSockets** – Facilitate real-time communication, commonly used in chat   applications.
4. **Wireshark** – A network protocol analyzer for debugging network communication.
5. **Postman** – Used for testing APIs.
6. **Apache Kafka** – A distributed event streaming platform for handling real-time data.
