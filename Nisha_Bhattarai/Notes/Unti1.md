**How does client server architecture works?**

- Client-Server Architecture is a distributed computing model where clients (users/devices) request services, and servers provide those services. This model is widely used in networking, web applications, and cloud computing.

Working Principle:

1. Client Requests: The client (browser, mobile app, etc.) sends a request over the network (e.g., HTTP request).
2. Server Processes Request: The server receives the request, processes it, and retrieves data (from a database or another service).
3. Response Sent Back: The server sends the response back to the client.
4. Client Displays Data: The client processes and displays the received response.

**What are the factors to be considered when designing a software?**

- When designing software, various technical, business, and user-experience factors should be considered:

1. Functional Requirements:
   Define core features and functionalities (e.g., login system, payment gateway).
2. Non-Functional Requirements:
   Performance: Speed, response time, efficiency.
   Scalability: Ability to handle increased load.
   Security: Encryption, authentication, authorization.
   Usability: User-friendly design, accessibility.
3. Architecture & Design Considerations:
   Modularity: Dividing into components (e.g., MVC architecture).
   Maintainability: Easy to update and fix bugs.
   Portability: Should work on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   Interoperability: Ability to communicate with other systems (APIs).
4. Hardware & Network Requirements:
   Bandwidth and server capacity.
   Cloud vs. on-premise hosting.
5. Compliance & Legal Considerations:
   GDPR for data privacy.
   Licensing and copyright issues.

**Why do we really need network programming tools and platform? Explain some of them.**

- Network programming tools and platforms are essential for developing and managing network-based applications such as web services, cloud applications, and communication systems.

Reasons for Network Programming:

1. Remote Communication: Enables applications to communicate over networks (e.g., HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP).
2. Data Sharing: Allows multiple users to access the same data over a network (e.g., cloud storage).
3. Real-time Processing: Supports instant messaging, video streaming, and online gaming.
4. Security & Monitoring: Helps in encrypting data and preventing cyber threats.
5. Automation: Automates network tasks like file transfers and system monitoring.
   Some Popular Network Programming Tools & Platforms:
   Java Networking (java.net) -> Provides support for TCP, UDP, and HTTP-based communication.
   Wireshark -> Network packet analyzer for monitoring network traffic.
   cURL -> Command-line tool for sending HTTP requests.
   Postman -> API testing and network request debugging.
