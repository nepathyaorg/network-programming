Question1: How does client server architecture works?

Answer: 
Client-server architecture is a networked model where tasks and services are divided between two main entities: the client and the server. In this setup, the client is typically a device or software that requests services or resources, such as a web browser or mobile app. The server, on the other hand, is a system or computer that provides the requested services, such as hosting websites or storing data. When a client needs a resource, it sends a request to the server over a network. The server processes this request, which may involve interacting with databases or other systems, and then sends a response back to the client. This communication is often facilitated through standardized protocols like HTTP for web requests or FTP for file transfers. The client-server model promotes efficiency and scalability, allowing servers to handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously while maintaining a clear division of responsibilities.

Client-server architecture Working:

1. Client-Server Roles:
    * Client: Requests services or resources (e.g., web browser, mobile app).
    * Server: Provides services or resources in response to client requests (e.g., web server, database server).

2. Communication:
    * Clients send requests to servers over a network (e.g., internet).
    * Servers process these requests and send responses back to the client.

3. Request-Response Model:
    * The client sends a request for information or action.
    * The server processes the request and sends a response.

4. Protocols:
    * Communication is facilitated using protocols like HTTP for web requests, FTP for file transfers, or SMTP for email.

5. Types of Servers:
    * Web Server: Serves web pages to clients.
    * Database Server: Handles database requests and queries.
    * File Server: Manages file storage and retrieval.
    * Mail Server: Manages email communication.

6. Scalability:
    * The server can handle multiple client requests simultaneously, enabling scalability.

7. Efficiency:
    * By delegating tasks between clients and servers, the architecture optimizes resource usage and improves system performance.
